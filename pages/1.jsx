									Node.js is an open-source, server-side runtime environment that allows developers to {" "}
									<strong>
										build scalable and high-performance web applications.
									</strong>{" "}
									It uses JavaScript as its scripting language, enabling both front-end and back-end development within a unified environment. With its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, Node.js excels at handling concurrent connections and processing requests efficiently.
								</p>
								<h3 className="mt30 mb20">
									Understanding the Basics of Node.js:
								</h3>
								<p>
									In this section, we&apos;ll explore the core concepts of Node.js. We&apos;ll discuss how it utilizes the V8 JavaScript engine to execute code, its single-threaded event loop model, and the role of modules in extending its functionality. Additionally, we&apos;ll cover how Node Package Manager (NPM) facilitates package management and dependency resolution in Node.js projects.
								</p>
								<h3 className="mt30 mb20">
									Building Scalable Web Applications with Node.js
								</h3>
								<p>
									Node.js shines when it comes to developing scalable web applications. Its asynchronous nature allows it to handle a large number of simultaneous connections without blocking the execution of other operations. We&apos;ll delve into the architecture of Node.js applications, including the use of callbacks, event emitters, and promises to handle asynchronous tasks. We&apos;ll also touch upon concepts such as clustering and load balancing to maximize the scalability of Node.js applications.
